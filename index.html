                <h2>Domectic Long and Shorthair</h2>
                <p>About 95 percent of all cats in Canada and the United States are domestic long or shorthair cats. Domestic shorthaired cats are the closest to the “wild type” and, regardless of the length of their coat, they aren’t a custom breed.</p>

                <h2>Ragdoll</h2>
                <p>Graceful and intelligent, Ragdolls are mild-mannered and sweet. Their large, striking blue eyes are discerning as well as affectionate. Growing to anywhere between 6-9 kg (15-20 lbs), it takes these long-haired beauties about three years to reach full maturity.</p>

                <h2>Exotic Shorthair</h2>
                <p>These playful fur babies make excellent companions and will follow you from room to room, waiting for a chance to hop in your lap as soon as you sit down.</p>

                <h2>Maine Coon</h2>
                <p>Maine Coons are magnificent when they reach their tallest height of 16 inches, length of up to 100 cm (40 in) and weigh in at 3.6-8.2 kg (7-18 lbs) or more. They have lovely tufts of fur in their ears and under their paws, a square face and a big fluffy tail. They are friendly, inquisitive, and very hardy, meaning that they can live in a variety of climates and require less care and attention than other breeds.</p>

                <h2>Persian</h2>
                <p>Big round eyes inside a round face give Persians their unmistakable look. Add in the flat face and the distinctive profile, or smushed nose, and you know you’ve found a gorgeous, soft, sweet-tempered Persian cat. Affectionate toward their owners, children, and other pets, Persians are generally not very active, preferring a quiet environment.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>British and American Shorthair</h2>
                <p>These Shorthairs are often described as having teddy bear features, round faces with big eyes. They are not clingy, but they do know when to give their owners some love. They are friendly toward their owners and children without wanting to be picked up or cuddled. Like other shorthaired cats, they require less grooming and shed less.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Siamese</h2>
                <p>Long and slender, Siamese may have an elongated, wedged-shaped face or a rounder, apple-shaped one. Their ears, noses, paws, and tails come in complementary colours that offset their cream-coloured bodies. With their short hair, they don’t  require the combing and care that a longhaired cat needs.</p>
